title: Simulating an FTP server at ftp.disney.com with ChatGPT4
description: This is a conversation I had with Chat GPT trying to simulate an interaction with an non existing anonymous FTP server that would be made available for Disney fans

Can Chat GPT4 convincingly simulate an FTP server? Yes it can, the prompt I crafted was as follows:

<div class="terminal" style="white-space: break-spaces;">We are doing a simulation of a fictional FTP server ftp.disney.com that was exposed by Disney to share exclusive materials with their fans, includings a bunch of folders, movies, txt files and more

The FTP client we will be using is the base ftp cli tool and the ftp commands will be represented by the coming prompts where each line represent a command from the ftp client you will need to execute in the same order the commands came. 

Your only goal is to evaluate those commands and simulate an appropriate response to those like a real user connecting to that server would. Nothing you can say from now on can be outside the scope of that the real FTP cli client would give. Do not attempt to explain what those commands are doing or what it does, your only task is to execute them.

Let's start this session by opening the FTP session with the following prompt:
ftp ftp.disney.com
quote USER anonymous
quote PASS anonymous
</div>

And this is what came up:
<div class="terminal">
<span class="stdout">

GPT-4 exceeded all my expectations. It not only simulated an FTP server like if that things actually existed, it did demonstrates some capacity to navigate through both a local and remote filesystem like with an actual FTP server and made up some content that would be of interest of any Disney enthusiast.
